/**
 * @defgroup joybus_rtc Joybus Real-Time Clock
 * @ingroup rtc
 * @brief Joybus Real-Time Clock interface.
 * @author Christopher Bonhage
 *
 * The Joybus real-time clock is a cartridge peripheral that uses a battery
 * to power a clock that tracks the date, time, and day of the week. The
 * real-time clock keeps running even when the N64 is powered-off. The
 * Joybus RTC is accessed through the serial interface (SI) similar to EEPROM
 * and controllers. The Joybus RTC was only ever available on one official
 * cartridge that was only available in Japan: D≈çbutsu no Mori (Animal Forest).
 * Many emulators and flash carts include support for the Animal Forest RTC,
 * which makes it possible to include real-time clock functionality in N64
 * homebrew!
 *
 * The Joybus RTC contains 3 "blocks" (or zones) which contain 8 bytes of data:
 * Block 0 contains a half-word control register and opaque calibration data.
 * Block 1 is unused and unsupported. See notes below.
 * Block 2 contains the current date/time as packed binary-coded decimal.
 *
 * Animal Forest did not use block 1 at all, so most emulators do not bother to
 * implement it. Theoretically, block 1 could be used as 8-bytes of SRAM-backed
 * storage, but this is not supported by libdragon's Real-Time Clock Subsystem.
 * If you need storage, consider using a standard cartridge save type or saving
 * to a Controller Pak.
 *
 * Unfortunately, since only one game ever used Joybus RTC (and that game was
 * later re-released on the GameCube in English), real-time clock support in
 * emulators and flash carts can be incomplete, inaccurate, or non-existent.
 * Many emulators do not actually implement the Joybus RTC write command and
 * always respond with the host device's current local time. Some emulators
 * and flash carts support writing to RTC but will not persist the date/time
 * after resetting or powering-off. You can run the `rtctest` example ROM on
 * your preferred emulator or flash cart to what RTC support is available.
 *
 * The only reliable way to check if writes are actually supported is to write
 * a time to the RTC and read the time back out. Many emulators that do
 * support RTC reads will silently ignore RTC writes. You should detect
 * whether writes are supported using #rtc_is_persistent so that you can
 * conditionally show the option to change the time if it's supported. If the
 * RTC supports writes, it is safe to call #rtc_set to set the date and time.
 *
 * Due to the inaccurate and inconsistent behavior of RTC reproductions that
 * currently exist, this subsystem trades-off complete accuracy with the actual
 * Animal Forest RTC in favor of broader compatibility with the various quirks
 * and bugs that exist in real-world scenarios like emulators and flash carts.
 *
 * Some notable examples of RTC support in the ecosystem (as of July 2021):
 *
 * 64drive hw2 fully implements Joybus RTC including writes, but requires
 * a 500ms delay after setting the time in order to read it back correctly.
 *
 * EverDrive64 3.0 and X7 partially support Joybus RTC, with caveats: The RTC
 * must be explicitly enabled in the OS or with a ROM header configuration;
 * RTC writes are not supported over Joybus -- changing the time must be done
 * in the EverDrive OS menu.
 *
 * UltraPIF fully implements an emulated Joybus RTC that can be accessed even
 * when the cartridge does not include the real-time clock circuitry.
 *
 * Internally, Joybus RTC cannot represent dates before 1990-01-01, although
 * some RTC implementations (like UltraPIF) only support dates after
 * 2000-01-01.
 *
 * Special thanks to korgeaux, marshallh and jago85 for their hard work
 * and research reverse-engineering and documenting the inner-workings
 * of the Joybus RTC.
